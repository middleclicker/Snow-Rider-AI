# Snow-Rider-AI
AI for https://fireboyand-watergirl.co/snow-rider-3d built using a deep q network

Bored so I made this

**IMPORTANT: CHANGE THE EPISODE COUNT TO SOMETHING HIGHER**
The current one was for me to test if it generated outputs correctly.


To run the AI:
  1. Open the game on a browser
  2. Run the DQN file
  3. Switch to the browser window within 3 seconds
  4. Dont fucking move anything, leave your computer on for like 20 hours
  5. Done!

Note: Might have to change some coordinates and stuff if your monitor isnt 1080p or your browser settings are different than mine, so please just check the code


Edit: Its broken, if anyone wants to look through it and find the bug please dm me on discord middleclicker#9990
